This is an example of how to use [minispec-rails gem](https://github.com/ordinaryzelig/minispec-rails).

There are 4 commits in this repository:

1. New, empty rails 5.1.1 app.
1. Scaffold.
1. Basic Mailer/Job.
1. Adding the gem and converting the tests to spec style.

To test that it works, run `bin/rails test test` (you need the last `test` to include the system tests).
